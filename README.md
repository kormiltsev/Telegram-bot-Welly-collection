# Telegram bot for collections

Story: 

My kid collect Welly's toy cars. In store need to check does this toy is already in collectoin. 
So I create Telegram bot to fast check (instead of an app =) )
Next step is make it universal. By the way Telegram UI is good alternative to create app on every OS.

Catalog of items, Telegram used as UI.
